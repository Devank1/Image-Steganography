# Image-Steganography
Steganography is an art of secret or invisible communication. The word steganography is derived from the Greek word ‘steganos’ mean- reticent (hidden) and ‘graphein’ means “to write”. Information can be hidden in various forms of files, it can be Text, video, audio, or image; these are used as the cover files where data is not visible. The most popular type of steganography is hiding information in a file containing a digital image or picture. Steganography is not actually a form of cryptography but another way of hiding/protecting the information in transit. Cryptography makes the data unreadable and focuses on keeping content secret whereas steganography keeps the presence of data secret. The advantage of steganography over cryptography is that it does not attract attention to find the file to be suspicious as there is merely any change visible to cover the file. The method used here for image steganography is LSB(least significant bit) substitution method.
